				<p>I am a deeply motivated first generation college student focused on building experience in business management for e-commerce based businesses, from start-ups to well established corporations. Right now, I am actively searching for an internship at a company that values diverse, team-oriented approaches for tackling consumer behavior and brand marketing projects. When Iâ€™m not perfecting my LinkedIn profile for job recruiters, you might also find me working on my own shoe customization business, learning the guitar, or training for my first Iron Man triathlon.</p>
